Constituency TreeBanks
============

When one talks about the “success” of a Natural Language Processing solution, they often refer to its ability to analyse the semantic and syntactic structure of a given sentence. Such a solution is expected to be able to understand both the linear and hierarchical order of the words in a sentence, unveil embedded structures, illustrate syntactical relationships and have a firm grasp of the argument structure. In order to meet the expectations, cutting edge Natural Language Processing systems like parsers, POS taggers or machine translation systems make use of syntactically or semantically annotated treebanks. Such treebanks offer a deep look through the surface and into the logical form of sentences.

Annotated treebanks can be categorised as constituency treebanks and dependency treebanks. Constituency treebanks offers clarity through resolving structural ambiguities, and successfully illustrates the syntagmatic relations like adjunct, complement, predicate, internal argument, external argument and such. 

The very first comprehensive annotated treebank, the Penn Treebank, was created for the English language and offers 40,000 annotated sentences. Following the Penn Treebank, numerous treebanks annotated for constituency structures were developed in different languages including French, German, Finnish, Hungarian, Chinese and Arabic.
